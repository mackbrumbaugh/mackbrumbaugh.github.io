I am a student at the University of Virginia where I am obtaining my master’s degree in media, culture, and technology with a certificate in women and gender studies. 

After I complete my master’s degree, I hope to start a PhD program in the media studies and communication fields with the intention of ultimately becoming a professor at a research-based institution.

At the University of Virginia, I am also a research assistant and lab manager for Sloane Lab, which is run by Dr. Mona Sloane.

The lab focuses on artificial intelligence as a social phenomenon that has the ability to impact a myriad of social conditions in our everyday lives.

I specifically am leading a project about AI and recruiting practices as it pertains to employment recruiters as well as the individuals who create and design the tech that recruiters utilize.

I am also working on projects about the efficacy of speech to text systems for individuals with aphasia, and gender discrimination and biases that are prevalent in AI-generated imagery.

My current research interests lie in film and television studies with an emphasis on queer and female representation, and how that representation translates into real life support, community, and identity creation for marginalized individuals.

Much of my work is rooted in the horror films and television as it is a genre that opens itself to expansive and progressive ways of thinking and being that many marginalized and discriminated individuals, such as women and queer people, can relate to and draw meaning from.

I want to continue my research in this area and build out queer horror studies as a field that has a lot to offer in terms of imagining new queer and gender subjectivities and realities, embracing the idea of queer utopic futures.
