###### Mack Brumbaugh

I am a current media studies master's student at University of Virginia where I specialize in audience research, queer and feminist theory, and genre studies. I am currently working on research about the television show Yellowjackets and how it is ushering in a new age of feminist television through their representations of subversive femininity that displays itself through acts of monstrosity. More generally, I am interested in how mediated representations and narratives impact the everyday lives and social worlds of women and queer individuals specifically. Outside of my own research, I am also the lab manager of Sloane Lab at the University of Virginia that is devoted to the critical study of artificial intelligence, along with being a research assistant under Professor Andrea Press for her upcoming work about sexual violence on college campuses. 

I am currently applying to communications and media studies PhD programs with the ultimate goal of becoming a faculty member at a research-based institution where I am able to blend my aptitude for producing high quality research with my passion for teaching and assisting first generation students in navigating the "hidden curriculum" of higher education.
