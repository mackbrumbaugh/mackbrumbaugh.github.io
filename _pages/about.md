I am a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, obtaining my master's in Media, Culture, and Technology in May 2025. While at UVA, my master’s thesis explored representations of subversive femininity and sexuality as portrayed in horror media and how audiences responded to these representations. Through this research, I developed intellectual strengths and interests in the film and television industry, audience reception research, and genre studies.  

I am currently applying to communications and cinema & media studies programs where I aim to explore the ways in which technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are disrupting the film and television industry, with a particular focus on streaming platforms. More specifically, I am interested in how these technologies deconstruct and reconstruct traditional film and television genres, ultimately changing the ways we order, categorize, and think about film and television.  

Since graduating from the University of Virginia, I have continued to work with the media studies department as an independent researcher. In this position, I am conducting research with Professor Andrea Press on gendered narratives and scripts that individuals utilize on dating apps or with a dating coach. I have also taken on the role of Managing Editor of The Communication Review, a prominent communication and media studies journal. I have also continued my role as a research assistant and lab manager of Sloane Lab, a research lab devoted to studying the social impacts of artificial intelligence across various sectors of everyday life.
