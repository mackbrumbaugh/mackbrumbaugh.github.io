In my work as a graduate teaching assistant, I mentored and guided students throughout the semester via feedback on grades and weekly office hours in a course focused on media history. I also gave guest lectures in the History of Media course offering students alternative narratives to traditional histories of computing by highlighting the work of marginalized queer, trans, and feminist scholars. I have previously assisted in courses both in the media studies and data science departments at the University of Virginia.
