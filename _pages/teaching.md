#### <u><b>Teaching Statement</b></u>

In my teaching practice, I emphasize an interdisciplinary approach focused on critical thinking, academic writing, and building the computational skills necessary for students to succeed in both their creative and entrepreneurial endeavors. After five years of teaching-â€“as an instructor of record, a teaching assistant, and a mentor to junior colleagues--I look forward to building on this strong foundation of educational practice. I have experience teaching on topics such as social computing, user-centered design, and research methodologies. I also have experience in course development at both the graduate and undergraduate level, as well as extensive experience in student mentoring.
